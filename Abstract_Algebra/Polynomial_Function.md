* Polynomial Function
  - Define
    $$\begin{align*}
      f(x) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i  \tag{one variable}  \\
      f(\boldsymbol x) &= \sum_{\boldsymbol i=(0,...,0)_n, i_j \le i_k, \forall j \le k}^{(\dim,...,\dim)_n} \left(a_{\boldsymbol i} · \prod_{i_j \in \boldsymbol i, x_0 = 1}x_{i_j} \right)  \tag{multi-variate}  
    \end{align*}$$

  - Property
    - For a univariate $N$-th degree equation, there is no root-finding formula composed of finite addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root operations from the fifth degree onwards.

    * Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
