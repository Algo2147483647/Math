# Convex Hull

[TOC]

## Define

A **convex hull** of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the points. 



## Compute the Convex Hull

#### 1. Find Minimum Point

- It finds the bottom-most (or left-most if there are ties) point among the given points. This point is guaranteed to be part of the convex hull.

#### 2. Sort Points by Polar Angle

- The points are sorted based on their polar angle with respect to the minimum point. This makes sure that when traversing these points in the sorted order, one forms a counterclockwise loop.

#### 3. Construct the Convex Hull

- The sorted points are traversed to construct the convex hull:
  - It initializes the convex hull with the first two points.
  - For each subsequent point, it checks if adding this point to the convex hull would still result in a convex shape.
  - This is done by using the cross-product to check the orientation of the triplet formed by the last two points in the hull and the current point.
  - If the shape is not convex, the second-to-last point is removed from the hull.
