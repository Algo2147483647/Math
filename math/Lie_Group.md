# $Lie\ Group$

[TOC]

## Define
A real Lie group is a [group](./Group.md) that is also a finite-dimensional real smooth [manifold](./Manifold.md), in which the group operations of multiplication and inversion are smooth maps. Smoothness of the group multiplication means that μ is a smooth mapping of the product manifold G × G into G.
