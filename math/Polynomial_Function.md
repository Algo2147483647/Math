# $Polynomial\ Function$

[TOC]

## Define
$$\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i x^i  \tag{one variable}  \\
  f(\boldsymbol x) &= \sum_{\boldsymbol i=(0,...,0)_n, i_j \le i_k, \forall j \le k}^{(\dim,...,\dim)_n} \left(a_{\boldsymbol i} Â· \prod_{i_j \in \boldsymbol i, x_0 = 1}x_{i_j} \right)  \tag{multi-variate}  
\end{align*}$$

Polynomial function is a kind of [function](./Function.md). ()

## Property

- For a univariate $N$-th degree equation, there is no root-finding formula composed of finite addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root operations $(+, -, \times, /, \sqrt{\ })$ from the fifth degree onwards.

* Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
  Every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. 
  
  Theorem states the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed.
