# $Martingale$

[TOC]

## Define  
Martingale is a discrete-time [stochastic process](./Stochastic_Process.md) that satisfies for any time $n$,
$$
\mathbb E(|X_n|) < \infty
$$
$$
\mathbb E(X_{n+1} \ |\ X_1, ..., X_n) = X_n
$$

The second condition means that the conditional expected value of the next observation, given all the past observations, is equal to the most recent observation.

## Property

- Doob-Meyer decomposition

- Stopping Time
  - Define  
    Stopping Time $\tau$ is a random variable defined on the filtered probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, (\mathcal F_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}, P)$ with value in $T = [0, +\infty)$, such that 
    $$
    \{\tau \le t\} \in \mathcal F_t \quad, \forall t \in T
    $$
  
  - Property
  
    - Optional stopping theorem
  
      Consider a stochastic process $\{X_t\}$ and a stopping time $\tau$ (a random variable that represents the time at which some event of interest occurs). The optional stopping theorem provides conditions under which
      $$
      \mathbb E(X_\tau) = \mathbb E(X_0)
      $$
