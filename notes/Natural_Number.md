# $Natural\ Number$

$$
\mathbb N

Natural numbers are formally defined by the Peano axioms, which are a set of axioms that describe the properties of natural numbers.

- $0$ is a natural number.
- Every natural number has a successor in the natural numbers.
- $0$ is not the successor of any natural number.
- If the successor of two natural numbers is the same, then the two original numbers are the same.
- If a set contains $0$ and the successor of every number is in the set, then the set contains the natural numbers. (Mathematical Induction)
