# $Ordered\ Set$

[TOC]

## Define

An ordered set, or more formally, a partially ordered set (poset), is a pair $(S, \le)$ consisting of a set $S$ and  a binary relation $\le$ that satisfies the following properties for all $a, b, c \in S$:

1. Reflexivity: $a \le a$.
2. Antisymmetry: If $a \le b$ and $b \le a$, then $a = b$.
3. Transitivity: If $a \le b$ and $b \le c$, then $a \le c$.


## Property

### Permutation

- Define  
  Permutation, is the arrangement of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements in a particular order. 

  The number of Conbination and Permutation Subsets
  $$A(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}  \tag{Permutation}$$

- Property
  * Full Permutation
    - Define  
      Full Permutation refers to all possible permutations of all elements in a sequence.  

    - Problem: Generate Full Permutation
      $$\begin{align*}
        f(\{a_i | i\in 1:n\}) 
        &= \{(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), (a_2, a_1, ..., a_n), (a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)\}  \\
        &= \cup_{i=1}^n (\{(a_i)\} × f(\{a_j\ |\ j ≠ i, j\in 1:n\}))  \tag{$×$: 序列合并}  \\
        f(\{a_1\}) &= \{(a_1)\}  \tag{initial}  \\
      \end{align*}$$
      
    - Property
      * Cantor Expansion  
        - Define  
          Cantor expansion is a bijection from a permutation sequence $a$ to a natural number $y$ that refer to the index of sequence in full permutation ordered by dictionary order. Where $f(a_i)$ is the number of elements smaller than $a_i$ and not appearing in $a_n:a_i$.
          $$y = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n f(a_i) (i-1)!$$
