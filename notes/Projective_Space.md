# $Projective\ Space$

[TOC]

## Define

Given a [vector space](./Linear_Space.md) $V$ over a field $K$, the projective space $\mathbf P(V)$ is the set of equivalence classes of $V - \{0\}$ under the equivalence relation $\sim$ (equivalence relation is defined by $x \sim y$ if there is a nonzero element $\lambda \in K$ such that $x = Î»y$).

## Property

- If $V$ is an $n+1$-dimensional vector space, then the corresponding projective space $\mathbf P(V)$ is $n$-dimensional
