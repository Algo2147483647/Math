# $Topological\ Space\ \&\ Open\ Set$

[TOC]

## Define  
Topological space $\tau$ is a collection of subsets of $S$, that is subsets of [power set](./Power_Set.md) $P(S)$, called the Open Sets, that satisfy certain axioms,

- The empty set and $S$ itself belong to $\tau$.
  $$\{\emptyset, S\} \subseteq \tau$$ 
- The intersection of any finite members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.
- Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of $\tau$ belongs to $\tau$.

## Concept

* Closed Set
  - Define  
    Closed Set is the complementary set of Open Set.  

## Property

* Homeomorphism
  - Define  
    A function $f: X \to Y$ between two topological spaces is a homeomorphism if it has the following properties,
    - $f$ is a bijection 
    - $f$ is continuous
    - the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is continuous ($f$ is an open mapping).
  
* Chart
  - Define  
    Chart $(U, \phi)$ on a set is a bijection $\phi: U \subseteq M \to \phi(U) \subseteq \mathbb R^n$, where $U, \phi(U)$ is open.

    A chart $(U, \phi)$ is centered at $p$ for $p \in U$ if $\phi(p) = 0$.

* Borel $\sigma$-algebra 

## Include

* Hausdorff Space
  - Define  
    Hausdorff Space $X$ is a topology space where, for any distinct points $x, y \in X$, there exist a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and a neighborhood $V$ of $y$ such that $U$ and $V$ are disjoint.
    $$U \cap V = \emptyset$$ 

  - Include
    * Metric Space  
    * Manifold
      - Define  
        Manifold $M$ is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space.
        - Hausdorff, $\forall x, y \in M$, there exists open neighborhoods $U_x, U_y \subseteq M$ with $x \in U_x, y \in U_y$ and $U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$.   
        - Second countable, there exits a countable collection $(U_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ of open set in $M$ such that for all $V \subseteq M$ open, and $p \in V$, there is some $n$ such that $p \in U_n \subseteq V$
        - Locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space, every point has a neighborhood $U$ homeomorphic $\phi: U \to V$ to an open subset $V$ of the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^n$ for some nonnegative integer $n$.
