# Filtered Probability Space & Filtration

- Define  
  $$(\Omega, \mathcal F, (\mathcal F_i)_{i \in I}, P)  \tag{Filtered Probability Space}$$ 
  Filtered Probability Space is a probability space with Filtration.

  $$(\mathcal F_i)_{i \in I}  \tag{Filtration}$$
  Filtration $(\mathcal F_i)_{i \in I}$ is a sequence of $\sigma$-algebra in a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$ and a index set $I$ with a total order $\le$, such that 
  $$\mathcal F_i \subseteq \mathcal F_j \quad, \forall i \le j$$

# Lévy process

- Define

  A Levy process is a stochastic process $X = \{X_t : t > 0\}$ that satisfies the following properties:
  1. $X_0 = 0$ almost surely
  2. Independence of increments: For any $0 < t_i < t_2 < \cdots < t_n < \infty, X_{t_2}-X_{t_1}$,$X_{t_3}- X_{t_2}, \cdots , X_{t_n}- X_{t_{n-1}}$ are mutually independent;
  3. Stationary increments: For any $s < t, X_t - X_s$ is equal in distribution to $X_{t-s}$
  4. Continuity in probability: For any $\epsilon > 0$ and $t \ge 0$ it holds that $\lim\limits_{h\to 0} P(|X_{t+h} - X_t| >\epsilon) = 0$.
      If $X$ is a Levy process then one may construct a version of $X$ such that $t \mapsto X_t$ is almost surely right-continuous with left limits.

# Ito Integral

- Define

  Suppose $B(t)$ is a standard Brownian motion (or Wiener process) and $f(t, B(t))$ is a process adapted to the filtration generated by $B(t)$. The lto integral of $f(t, B(t))$ with respect to $B(t)$ over the interval $[0, T]$ is given by:
  $$
  \int_0^T f(t, B(t))\ \mathrm d B(t)
  $$
  This integral is understood in the mean-square sense, and its existence and properties are based on a limiting procedure using simple predictable processes.
  
  Ito's Lemma
  $$
  \mathrm d g(t, B(t))=\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} \mathrm d t+\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} \mathrm d B(t)+\frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial^{2} g}{\partial x^{2}} \mathrm d t
  $$

- Property
  - 期望为零: 对于某些条件下的 f(t,B(t))，lto积分的期望为零
  - 二次变差: lto积分的方差 (或二次变差) 可以计算为f2(t,B(t))dt.

# Stochastic differential equation

$$
d X_t = a(X_t) dt + b(X_t) dW_t
$$

# Real Field

The real number system $(R, +, \cdot, <)$ can be defined [axiomatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system) up to an [isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism), which is described hereinafter.

The set IR is a field, meaning that addition and multiplication are defined andhave the usual properties.
The field IR is ordered, meaning that there is a total order 2 such that for allreal numbers x, y and z.
.if x> y then x+ z2 y+ Z
if x > 0 and yz 0, then xy > 0.The order is Dedekind-complete, meaning that every nonempty subset S of Rwith an upper bound in R has a least upper bound (a.k.a., supremum) in R.

# Complex Field 

A complex number is a number of the form $a + bi$, where $a, b \in \mathbb R$, and i is an indeterminate satisfying $i^2 = −1$.
